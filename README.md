# 🚀 Ajackus Assessment - React CRUD App

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **React.js** ⚛️ - For building the Frontend
- **Tailwind CSS** 🎨 - Styling with ease
- **JSONPlaceholder API** 🌐 - Mock backend for CRUD operations

## 🔥 Project Overview

This project is a **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application** built from scratch using first-principles thinking. The entire implementation follows a **brute-force methodology** to ensure robust and efficient design.

## 📌 Features & Implementation

1. **Fetching Data** 📥 - Initially, I implemented the feature to fetch and display user data from JSONPlaceholder API.
2. **Add User** ➕ - Developed a structured form to add new users dynamically.
3. **Edit User** ✏️ - Implemented an inline editing feature to modify user details.
4. **Delete User** ❌ - Added a smooth delete functionality with confirmation.
5. **UI & UX** 🎨 - After ensuring all functionalities were solid, I designed a clean and intuitive interface, making the app professional and user-friendly.

## 🎯 Professional Approach

- **Structured Development** 🏗️ - Followed a step-by-step approach, ensuring each functionality was implemented before UI enhancements.
- **First-Principles Thinking** 🤔 - Focused on understanding the core of CRUD operations rather than relying on pre-built libraries.
- **Scalable Component Design** 🏛️ - Components were built modularly for reusability and maintainability.
